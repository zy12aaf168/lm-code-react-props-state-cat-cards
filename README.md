## How to Get Started

Fork this repo to your Github and then clone the forked version of this repo

To install the dependencies run:

### `npm install`

or if use yarn:

(They both do the same thing)

Make sure you're in the right directory!

To start the app:

### `npm start`

or if you use yarn:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The app should open in your browser.

If the page doesn't open automatically, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits 👍

You will also see any lint errors in the console ✅

Meow, lets get started!

# Learning ~~Recat~~ Recap

So previously on Cat Cards The React App we learnt:

-   about the file structure of a React application
-   that a component is a reusable piece of code that looks like a JavaScript function but returns JSX

Cool. 😺

Head over to [Activity 1](./activities/activity_1.md) to get started!
